## Description

As a developer, I want a README file generator to quickly create a professional README for a new project.

1. Create a command-line application that accepts user input.
2. When I am prompted for information about my application repository, I get a quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of your project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
3. When I enter my project title, this is displayed as the title of the README.
4. When I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
5. When I choose a license for my application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added hear the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
6. When I enter my GitHub username, this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile.
7. When I enter my email address, this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions.
8. When I click on the links in the Table of Contents, I am taken to the corresponding section of the README.
